    <p><strong>This drink already looks so good it does not need garnish</strong></p>

    <p>The Last Word is my personal favorite cocktail. It has it all! It is a little sweet, herbal, tangy and got a kick to it.
        it has the potential to be drank as an aperativo or as a digestivo.I also <em>really</em> would not mind one at the end of the night! the only thing about this drink I dont like all too much is the fact that because of the acidity you get incredible heartbuirn after only 3 glasses.
    Though let me tell you that after three glasses you probably had enough anyway.</p>
