            This butter burger is, as the name implies, dripping with butter. Not the healthiest snack but o so delicious.
        </p>

        <p>
            A butterburger has everything, from the buns to the patty's, covered in butter. 
            The idea is to mix in butter with the fatty ground beef. After making the patty's you fry the patty's in butter.
            The buns are butter buns toasted in butter and then buttered up. This burtger has a mere 3 condements. 
            One is the pickle, then we have the all american cheese, and last but not least we have the caramalized onions.
            When I say caramalized I mean caramalized in tons of butter for a long, long time (a good 40min to 1hr).
